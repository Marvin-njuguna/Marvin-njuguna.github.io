<p class="txt">A community where ink speaks and we listen...</p>
<p class="story">

The Inkjection tattoo parlor was set up in 2012 in the wake of working in different tattoo shops and parlors in Nairobi, the author, Alice Danley, had a significant thought: why not make a tattoo shop that never compromises?

The thought didn’t sound significant, anyway he would say, compromising was the standard for some different shops.

This time, nothing would be saved so as to give the best inking background to his customers and craftsmen, without exception. The thing that matters is clear when you initially enter the shop.

Customers are treated as family and end up innovative accomplices in the plan of their tattoo. We just use cutting edge inking hardware, propelled cross-pollution aversion practices, and pride ourselves to give a definitive scrupulousness.

The most abnormal amounts of tidiness are carefully kept up while giving a domain that radiates a quieting feeling of welcome and acknowledgment for everybody.

We pride ourselves on tuning in to our clients and fitting their thoughts into a tattoo perfect work of art that will endure forever.

Our craftsmen have some expertise in Custom Designs, Neo-Traditional, Fineline, Dot-Work, White Ink Tattooing, Black and Gray, Japanese-Inspired, American Traditional, Geometric, Watercolor, Trash Polka, High Graphic, and Hand Poked Tattoos.

As committed specialists, our work mirrors an increasingly close to home creative heading while as yet holding fast to conventional tattoo beliefs.

By taking a gander at both our tattoo fill in and in addition our craft, one can remember we are differing yet reliable and can adjust to numerous styles and bearings.

We are intrigued and put resources into making your tattoo individual and unique, and we endeavor to make your entire experience an agreeable and pleasant one.

Make sure to look at our news area on this site. Everybody who works at the shop is engaged with different undertakings, aesthetic and melodic, and different occasions and festivities of our own and of our partners.

While we can give general costs and make arrangements via telephone, we energize anybody keen on our work or in looking for a no-commitment meeting, to visit the shop and come talk with us face to face.

Look at our portfolios and our specialty. Or then again to investigate our shop and our display here on the site.

On the off chance that you are hoping to address an explicit tattooer, it’s constantly shrewd to call first to ask about the week after week calendar of every craftsman. Arrangements are favored however we can as a rule acknowledge walk-ins every day. 
    
Regardless of whether you come in with an obscure thought or a got done with illustration, we will work with you to make your tattoo vision a reality.

At <a class="ink"href="index.html">Inkjection</a>, we trust that tattoos are something beyond ink on skin – they can be both celebratory and mending and are a lasting method to remember our lives. 
    
We pride ourselves on being a LGBTQ+ inviting tattoo shop and don’t endure sexism, bigotry, homophobia, xenophobia, or bias of any sort.
